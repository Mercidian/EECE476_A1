The benchmark you will use to test your simulator can be run using the following command:

	./sim-ece552 fpppp.ss < ./natoms-input.in

The simulation should take around 2 minutes to complete.  


About this benchmark
====================

The benchmark, "fpppp" is from the SPEC 95 benchmark suite.  The source code for it
is written in Fortran (we do not give you this source code--you will not need it).  The 
binary is relatively small yet this benchmark can still result in many instruction cache 
misses on modern high-speed processors that do not have special mechanisms to "prefetch" 
instructions into the instruction cache before they are needed.

Here is some additional information on "fpppp" from www.SPEC.org

    * From the Gaussian series of quantum chemistry benchmarks 
      (two electron integral derivative).
    * The atoms in 145.fpppp are placed in a relatively compact 
      region of space positioned in a graphite-like lattice. To 
      accomplish this, code has been added that computes an atom's 
      coordinates a a site on an orthorhombic lattice with a 
      Gaussian deviation. The '92 version had a mistakenly linear 
      arrangement of the atoms.
    * Cannot be parallelized (the behavior of each atom is affected 
      be the behavior of each one of the other atoms).
    * Minimal cache footprint. Mostly a test of register 
      allocation/performance.
    * Good exhibition of superscaler performance features.
